👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 [This is simply the best exposition on AI](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EUrOxh_0leE).



It reminds me of Daniel Schmachtenberger’s commentary on [why we're creating a future that nobody wants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzCVzyTktR0&list=PLmEjIyRQgARhMMUyD8lXhX2FtS_7P-hPi). Because, after watching [Angela Collier explain why AI does not exist, why it is unethical, and why we are stuck with this mess](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EUrOxh_0leE), you too will agree, this is a future nobody wants. 

And her commentary on “prompt engineers” is \**chef’s kiss*\*.
