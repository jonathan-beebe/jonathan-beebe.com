Like many Americans, I am deeply troubled by America‚Äôs slide into an authoritarian and fascist government. I have started collecting the following resources as I strive to understand the history of how we got here (because [none of this is new]({{< ref "posts/2025-02-21-origins-of-totalitarianism" >}})), where we are going, and what I can do about it. 

# Definition of Terms

First, it is helpful to have a definition of terms. These terms are often thrown around as badges of honor or slurs of accusation, with little regard to their actual meaning. Within the context of this site, I try to use these words as accurately as possible. Words have meaning, and using them correctly is important. *All definitions sourced from The New Oxford American Dictionary, Apple‚Äôs macOS dictionary, and [*A Brief History of How We Got Here*](https://overcast.fm/+AA1RBVEH8g0).*

**Authoritarianism**
: the enforcement or advocacy of strict obedience to authority at the expense of personal freedom.

**Autocracy**
: a system of government by one person with absolute power.

**Capitalism**
: an economic and political system where private citizens own and control the businesses, property, and capital (means of production) for profit.

**Communism**
: a political theory derived from Karl Marx, advocating class war and leading to a society in which all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs.

**Democracy**
: rule of the people.
: a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives. *Keyword "eligible", not always **all** of the people get the right to vote. In America it wasn‚Äôt until 1870 when African American men got the right to vote, and 1920 for woman, and not until 1965 when the Voting Rights Act tried to protect minority voting rights‚Äîand it has been under attack ever since.*

**Despot**
: a ruler or other person who holds absolute power, typically one who exercises it in a cruel or oppressive way.

**Fascism**
: an authoritarian, intolerant, and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization.

**Oligarch**
: a very rich business leader with a great deal of political influence (particularly with reference to individuals who benefited from the privatization of state-run industries after the collapse of the Soviet Union).

**Oligarchy**
: a small group of influential (and often, but not necessarily, wealthy) people having control of a country, organization, or institution. Sometimes confused with *plutocracy*.

**Nazi**
: a person with extreme racist or authoritarian views.
: a person who seeks to impose their views on others in a very autocratic or inflexible way.
: *historical* a member of the far-right National Socialist German Workers' Party.

**Plutocracy**
: a country or society governed by the wealthy.
: an elite or ruling class of people whose power derives from their wealth.

**Socialism**
: a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.

**Totalitarianism**
: a system of government that is centralized and dictatorial and requires complete subservience to the state.

**Tyranny**
: a cruel and oppressive government.

# Christianity‚Äôs Role

Christian Nationalists are one of the primary voting bases for authoritarianism, giving rise to Trumpism and opening the doors to bigotry, hate, and tyranny. It is worth understanding how a religion professing mercy, love, and compassion has been twisted to bring so much hate and evil, and why they are so intent to legislate their morality on all of us.
