title: 'What are you most pulled toward?'
---

> . . . a recognition of what is your dharma which is, what are the problems you feel most pulled to and you can’t turn away from . . . pour your whole devotion into it.  [^1]

This quote grabbed me. I don’t normally use the word “dharma”. I had to look it up.

> ***dharma***: *the eternal and inherent nature of reality, essential quality or character, as of the cosmos or one’s own nature.*

So expanding the intro quote it becomes,

> . . . a recognition of what is your *inherent nature or reality, essential quality, character, or nature* which is, what are the problems you feel most pulled to and you can’t turn away from . . . pour your whole devotion into it.

I love how the speaker, Daniel Schmachtenberger, connects one’s eternal nature or essential character with their inner pull towards solving specific problems. We are each capable of seeing the problems surrounding us with unique perspectives. We bring unique experiences. 

I don’t ask my son, “what do you want to *be* when you grow up. I ask him, “what problems *do you want to solve*?” Because I want him to know that he isn’t his work. But his work can be an expression of his essential qualities.

Our work isn’t what we are. What we are points us towards the most fulfilling and impactful work we can do.
