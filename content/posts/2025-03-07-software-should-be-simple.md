I found myself agreeing with every "great sofware design" statement in [this post](https://www.seangoedecke.com/great-software-design/). 

> Great software design looks underwhelming.
>
> Great software design is supposed to be too simple.
>
> Great software design doesn’t mean that your software is ultra-performant. It means that it’s a good fit for the task.
>
> Great software design looks simple because it eliminates as many failure modes as possible during the design stage.
>
> great software design is boring and unsexy. . . . Great software design doesn’t look like big exciting ideas. Most of the time it doesn’t look like anything at all.

The longer I am in software engineering, the more these ideas resonate with me. Great software is *simple*. Perhaps paradoxically, it is often harder to find the simple solution. That is where the hard work of being a software engineer comes in.
