1. Passing life hacks to your past self is pretentious. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you need to do this.
2. Be grateful for the wisdom you have accumulated. After all, it could’ve taken you another decade.
3. It is ineffective and unhealthy to ruminate on past missteps. Far better to consider making your very next step the healthiest and most effective you can.
4. Be grateful for the journey you are on right now. If your journey was different, you would be different. Are you sure you would like that version of yourself better?
5. Don’t pine after the self you could have been yesterday. Strive for the version you want to become tomorrow. Even better, rest content with who you are today.
