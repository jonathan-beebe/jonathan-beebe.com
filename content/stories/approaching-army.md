# Approaching Army

If you _were_ listening, you’d barely detect the subtle clicking sounds of the invisible approaching army.

The only problem is, you’re not listening.

The first sentinel breaches the structure.

_Scramble to the top.  
Scale the edge.  
Duck for cover.  
Slide directly under the target.  
Freeze.  
Wait for confirmation of safety.  
Signal the others._

Abruptly, erratically, the swarm follows. Inky blackness fills with resonant clicking.

_Approach the target.  
Secure the area.  
Swarm._

_Feast._

They devour what’s not theirs. This scavenging band of warriors consumes the waste and filth of others like it’s pure melted gold.

The roaches have arrived.

## Backstory

I wrote this piece after entering an apartment late one night, flipping on a light, and seeing a swarm of roaches on the patio outside immediately run and hide. They slid into the cracks between the floor boards, antennae twitching, waiting for the light to go off so they could return to their swarming activities.

It was creepy.

Yet, weirdly inspiring.
