*I enjoy writing short stories, mostly flash fiction of less than 1,000 words, along with the occasional poem. While fictional, there is an autobiographical nature to my writing. I draw from my past and my interiority. I often use writing as a way to explore ideas I am wrestling with or situations I am growing through.*
