# Hi, Iâ€™m **Jonathan Beebe**

I am a software engineer, photographer, writer, and a father. This web page is a simple playground for my [professional](/posts) and [creative](/stories) writing.

## A few things to check out

### 1/ Read my most recent posts

I mostly write about technology, software engineering, and more recently politics, as I strive to understand our ever-changing world. But I am a generalist, so I do enjoy writing about adjacent and even unrelated areas.

My three most recent posts:

### 2/ Connect with me

Here are some of the places you can find me around the internet. I love making connections with poeple who have shared interests.

### 3/ Check out my creating writing

I enjoy writing [short stories](/stories), mostly flash fiction of less than 1,000 words. While fictional, there is an autobiographical nature to my writing. I draw from my past and my interiority. I often use writing as a way to explore ideas I am wrestling with or situations I am growing through.
