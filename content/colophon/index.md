### Tech

I decided to take a simple and homegrown approach to this site. It is built using the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/). It is hosted on Github Pages. All the source code is visible in a [public github repository](https://github.com/jonathan-beebe/jonathan-beebe.com/).

This site uses no javascript and collects no metrics. I have no idea what my page views are or how many unique visitors I get. This keeps my focus on writing what I want to write, not catering to content that drives numbers.

### Design

The design of this site is simple and minimalistic. For most pages the default font is the system font of your devicesâ€™ operating system. The one exception is the [stories collection]({{< ref "/stories" >}}), where I chose an [Iowan Old Style book font from Online Web Fonts](https://www.onlinewebfonts.com/download/1e7b25c83a23600d1ab17ef5d3af3402).
