This is the personal site of Jonathan Beebe where I share some of my writings and musings.

I enjoy writing [short stories](/stories), mostly flash fiction of less than 1,000 words. While fictional, there is an autobiographical nature to my writing. I draw from my past and my interiority. I often use writing as a way to explore ideas I am wrestling with or situations I am growing through.

Professionally, I create digital products. I help non technical people turn their ideas into working software so they can focus on their business.

Over the past two decades I have helped design, build, and ship over 15 digital products. I helped at least three businesses go from zero to over $1 million in revenue. I have started and grown software engineering teams. I lead technology for a $150 million business. I built a digital bank. I have even founded three businesses myself (an online market & import business, a large format print shop, and a digital products company).

If you have an idea you want to prototype or bring to market, send me a messagse. Maybe I can help? One of my strengths is demystifying technology and helping my clients know what is the next right step.

Here are some nice things people have said about me professionally:

> “Jon has a very rare pairing of creative and technical genius, allowing him to tackle advanced mathematical programming problems while coming up with creative business ideas.”

> “You're a great, thoughtful people leader-and a kickass engineer. I seldom see both.”

> “Through his gentle yet firm mentoring and guidance, his subtle yet bold leadership, and thought-provoking questions like those, I have experienced tremendous personal and professional growth. He is by far the best leader I’ve ever been able to work with, technical or otherwise. I consider working with him the highlight of my career.”
