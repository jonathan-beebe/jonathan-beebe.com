Professionally, I create digital products. I help non technical people turn their ideas into working software so they can focus on their business.

Over the past two decades I have helped design, build, and ship over 15 digital products. I helped at least three businesses go from zero to over $1 million in revenue. I have started and grown software engineering teams. Previously I lead technology for a $150 million business. I built a digital bank. I have even founded three businesses myself (an online market & import business, a large format print shop, and a digital products company).

Currently I am helping [Skin Clique](https://www.skinclique.com/) grow its digital product business.

If you have an idea you want to prototype or bring to market, send me a messagse. Maybe I can help? One of my strengths is demystifying technology and helping my clients know what is the next right step.

I enjoy writing [short stories](/stories), mostly flash fiction of less than 1,000 words. While fictional, there is an autobiographical nature to my writing. I draw from my past and my interiority. I often use writing as a way to explore ideas I am wrestling with or situations I am growing through.

Here are some nice things people have said about me professionally:

> “Jon has a very rare pairing of creative and technical genius, allowing him to tackle advanced mathematical programming problems while coming up with creative business ideas.”

> “You're a great, thoughtful people leader-and a kickass engineer. I seldom see both.”

> “Through his gentle yet firm mentoring and guidance, his subtle yet bold leadership, and thought-provoking questions like those, I have experienced tremendous personal and professional growth. He is by far the best leader I’ve ever been able to work with, technical or otherwise. I consider working with him the highlight of my career.”
